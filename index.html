      <p> Here is poetry i would like to share </p>
      <P>
         <h3><em stlye="color: crimson" Lakes></em></h3>
         Take me to lakes where all the poets went to shine,</em><br>
            Where verses sparkle on the water like stars align.<br>
            In the moonlit reflections, a poetic design,<br>
            A celestial dance, where words and ripples entwine.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Take me to lakes where all the poets went to rise,</em><br>
            Where aspirations float, reaching for the skies.<br>
            Each ripple a stanza, each wave a poetic prize,<br>
            A symphony of dreams echoing in the moonlit guise.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Let the waters hold the echoes of poetic grace,</em><br>
            A gallery of verses in the serene embrace.<br>
            Where the soul finds solace, in this sacred space,<br>
            In lakeside dreams, a poet finds their resting place.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Take me to lakes where the spirit finds its song,</em><br>
            Where the heart's reflection knows it truly belongs.<br>
            In quitetude of nature where dreams belong<br>
            A lakeside santuary where poet sprit is strong
